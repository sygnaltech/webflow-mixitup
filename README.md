# webflow-mixitup
WebFlow + MixItUp Framework

This is a framework to simplify and streamline integration of the MixItUp library into WebFlow projects.

It's designed around two key aspects-

** DYNAMIC CARDS**

+ Streamlined markup for a WebFlow Collection List, to prepare it for MixItUp.

** DYNAMIC FILTER BUTTONS **

+ Streamlined markup for dynamic filter buttons, also likely generated via Collection List


The typical base design configuration we're working with is

1. A WebFlow CMS collection (content)
2. A WebFlow CMS collection (categories)
3. A single-reference field from content to category
